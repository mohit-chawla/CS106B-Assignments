We touch I feel a rush
We clutch 
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust its torturous, 
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos 
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this, 
I've tried in this department but 
I ain't had no luck with this, 
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breathe away
Your a supernova, and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take, 
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, 
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, 
Let down my guards swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give 
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me 
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you
